summary: Why bother starting a blog in 2019 ? Here are some explanations about the purpose of this blog and who I am.

Hello dear reader,

This article aims at explaining what's the purpose of this blog and who I am.

### Why This Blog ?

When you think of it, we are all living in a complex mesh of humans & machines interacting together through multiple networks. And we have always been, in a way. Before the industrial age, even if machines were less important, they have played a major role in the building of complex societies. Think about Gutenberg's printing press.

Some things don't change: the information we exchange has always been growing: the network is always becoming faster & more dense.

Some things change: it seems that we have more and more machines helping us to manage information: creating, storing, sorting, searching information. Machines seem to become more and more important (influential ?) in this mesh.

This kind of thought arose within me when I discovered the [Actor-Network Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory), a field of sociology where:

> everything in the social and natural worlds exists in constantly shifting networks of relationship.

I recently found that Tim O'Reilly was sharing a similar way of seeing the world in his recent book [_What's The Future_](https://www.oreilly.com/tim/wtf-book.html):

> Increasingly, I’d been watching a kind of Cambrian explosion in applications for collective intelligence [...]. Billions of connected humans and devices were being woven into a global brain. That brain was all of us, augmented and connected.

Another way of saying that we are tiny actors in a big network, like a brain.

That's what I want to discuss and share in this blog.

### Manifesto of This blog

Here are the convictions I wish to question & share through this blog:

- The future will be build by people able to communicate efficiently with humans & machines.
- _communicating efficiently_ means communicating with a high impact in terms of number of humans or machines impacted and in terms of relevancy & durability of the information transmitted: How many people & machines can I impact ? How well can I change their behaviour ?
- _communicating with humans_ appeals to social skills, emotional intelligence, arts. Either through real life contact or through machines (social networks).
- _communicating with machines_ appeals to engineering, coding, data science.
- People able to master both types of communication, i.e. people able to communicate both with humans & machines, will create exceptional value.

### Who Am I ?

My name is Quentin Chenevier. I live in [Toulouse, France](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Toulouse).

### Why I Love Machines

I've followed a very rational & maths-based cursus & studied many different machines: I'm really happy to study complex systems built by Humans.

I graduated in 2010 from the [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), with a major in remote sensing, where I studied. From there, I had the opportunity to work on amazingly complex machines which evolve in all kind of environments:

- In space, like [spectrometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_atmospheric_sounding_interferometer)
- In the sky, like [cockpits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockpit)
- In the cloud (haha), like [data science apps](http://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2017/06/airbus-launches-new-open-aviation-data-platform--skywise--to-sup.html)

All those machines have one thing in common: they process huge amounts of information.

### Why I Love Humans

When I started meditation in 2016, it has helped me to better understand my own thinking processes and having more empathy for others. As a result, I started to read a lot about psychology, sociology and cognitive sciences. Since then, the beauty of the Human's mind and the complexity of its inner workings has never stopped to amaze me.

I also graduated an MBA in 2018 from the [Toulouse Business School](http://www.tbs-education.fr/en), which is a great place to learn business & management and to start learning about sociology. From there, I began to be passionate about how organizations work. After all, they are complex systems made of Humans & Machines made by Humans.
