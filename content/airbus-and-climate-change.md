summary: Resigning from Airbus allowed me to have sincere discussions with my colleagues about Climate Change. The result was unexpected.

# Airbus and Climate Change

"*You are resigning AGAIN*" a british colleague told me, jokingly. Yes, I resigned twice from this company during the last 10 years. This time I learned a lot in the process.

## Why I left Airbus 

First time I left it was to chase new opportunities and live new experiences, after having spent 5 years in the same company. Fun fact: colleagues told me that's "courageous to resign", because Airbus ~~is~~ *was* a company where nobody resigns, unless pushed to do so.

The second time I resigned is a bit different. It's because my activities were too specific to Airbus - mainly dealing with the bureaucracy a.k.a stakeholder management - which made me fear for my employability.

That's OK if you imagine spending your entire life in a company, which is pretty usual among Airbus employees. But I'm not. And wondering *when* you'll leave the company while seeing your employability going down at the same time is pretty scary. **I felt like being trapped slowly.** ðŸª¤

In other words, the underlying reason why I resigned from Airbus is that **I did not imagine pursuing my career in the company.** The more I try to envisage Airbus' future, the more I believe that **Airbus will have to downscale dramatically at one point.** And it won't be pretty. In my opinion, better leave the ship before it gets nasty.

Let's make it clear: **my move is not a political statement**. I'm not trying to pose as an environmental activist here. I'm just trying to save my career.

Out of sheer curiosity, I wondered if my colleagues shared the same feeling or not. And I have been surprised by what I discovered when I opened the debate with a few of them.

## An hazardous strategy

I remember well when I received the email from our CEO announcing "[rate 70 by 2025](https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-05-airbus-provides-suppliers-with-an-update-on-production-plans)". An unexpected decision, given the previous announcements about "[launching a green aircraft program by 2025](https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/stories/2020-09-these-new-airbus-concept-aircraft-have-one-thing-in-common)". It's maybe not impossible to do both strategies, but they seem opposed in purpose. I understood this "rate 70" statement as "going green won't save us, so let's hit the gas pedal while nobody is watching". In my opinion, this strategy is hazardous. 

So I shared this view with several colleagues:
* Climate change impacts are already important in the world (megafires, floods and also locally in our region (record-breaking heatwaves, megafires) and will be worse in the future 
* There are examples of other carbon intensive industries which are already facing strong feedback from society, such as:
  * regulation forcing them to reduce their footprint, like [cattle reduction in Netherlands due to nitrogen pollution](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/15/netherlands-announces-25bn-plan-to-radically-reduce-livestock-numbers)
  * demonstrations of activists blocking their industrial sites, like [activists blocking the expansion of a coal mine in Germany](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-climate-activists-protest-against-coal-mine-expansion/a-61570306)
  * difficulties to hire top talents, like [oil & gas companies](https://www.oilandgasiq.com/decarbonization/articles/think-its-bad-now-talent-crunch-in-oil-and-gas-expected-to-worsen)
* Aerospace is not yet constrained by such feedbacks but more and more voices are calling for regulations to reduce air travel, like [France banning short-haul flights when a train line exists on the same path](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/12/france-ban-some-domestic-flights-train-available-macron-climate-convention-mps) (the law has been voted 1 year ago but [hasn't come into effect yet](https://www.france24.com/fr/europe/20220824-renoncer-aux-vols-int%C3%A9rieurs-en-france-une-mesure-pionni%C3%A8re-en-suspens))
* With climate impacts worsening, we should expect stronger feedback from society, especially if our strategy is shamelessly to accelerate the production rate. At some point the strategy may fail, due to new regulations or demonstrations blocking the FALs.

In other words, even if aircrafts were glamorous symbols of humankind progress, we cannot ignore that they are big fuel-burning machines, and at some point the society might stop our company in its plans to build more of it.

## How to analyse the reactions to an existential threat

The climate impact of our products is kind of a taboo in Airbus. No policy formally forbids to discuss this, but nobody is willing to discuss this spontaneously. This is one of the implicit rules that people follow in Airbus. Another example of implicit rules is the dress code: you won't see a man wearing shorts on site. It's not formally forbidden, but everybody knows that you shouldn't do it.

But during my notice period, I felt more free to try to discuss the topic with my colleagues (since I had let go all careers prospects in the company haha). So I made a small experiment: I discussed with 13 colleagues during my 3-month notice period and, after each discussion, I meticulously wrote minutes to analyze them later, in the spirit of a sociological study. Those colleagues didn't know that I was doing this social experiment, so they have been bluntly honest with me, and of course I'll respect their anonymity. Also I'm citing (nearly) exact quotes of them in *"italics with double quotes"*.

After analysis, I classified my colleagues' reactions in 5 classes, ranging from **denial** to **acceptance**, like the [5 stages of grief](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief):
		
**Denial â†’ Anger â†’ Bargaining â†’ Depression â†’ Acceptance**

This tool was meant to describe the emotional states of terminally ill patients, but it works as well to describe reactions to a future existential threat. ðŸ˜… 

So, where am I in this emotional landscape ? Let's have a look ðŸ‘‡

My mental state when I think about Airbus' current strategy is **depression**: It makes me sad that the company is following this hazardous path, but I (finally) acknowledged that I cannot do much about it.

## From denial and anger

And I was a bit scared to discuss this topic with my colleagues, because I was expecting a majority of reactions of *denial* and *anger*. This is how imagined it ðŸ‘‡

![](https://github.com/qchenevier/public_images/raw/master/2022/5%20stages%20of%20grief%20step%201.png)

It doesn't feel comfortable, right? But during the 13 interviews I conducted, I only noticed one reaction of **anger**, which, to my relief, wasn't directed at me: *"Young people are doing climate demonstrations, but how many of them are really willing to make a substantial effort?"*.

Regarding denial, reactions were of two kinds. I got only once the classic **"it's not our fault"** denial such as *"I think that climate change is due to solar activity, not humans."*. I also heard a [whataboutist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism) argument, pretty common in all industries, saying "**we are not the worst**": *"We are not the worst polluting industry. Look at the clothes industry, like H&M, Zara, etc."*.

And several people think that **"the strategy is not a problem"**: 

- *"Rate 70 is our biggest industrial challenge, everybody in the company should roll up their sleeves."*
- *"The market demand is strong, we have to grab it before Boeing does."*
- *"This strategy is viable for the next 15 years (but maybe not later)."*

## To bargaining and depression

But I have to admit that, contrary to my prior belief (as shown in the drawing above), **denial and anger weren't the majority** of the reactions.

Actually, most people were **bargaining** with the reality, using far-fetched arguments to justify that "**our dirty strategy is actually a green strategy, but this is a secret**":

- *"I can understand that the CEO is compelled to please our shareholders and investors. That's why he's pushing this short-term strategy."*
- *"The rate 70 strategy is way to put pressure on Airbus' industrial system and set it in motion. It' s a way to prepare to launch the next program which will be green."*
- *"The rate 70 strategy is only there to grow our backlog of orders. But maybe all those aircrafts in the backlog won't be produced and will be converted into orders for a new green aircraft program."*

Also some people, as they couldn't find a justification for the strategy, bargained with reality by saying **"I compensate with my daily actions"**:

- *"My kids are trashing me because I work in Airbus. They ask me to change company. I'm justifying my job by telling them that I'm trying to change the system from the inside."*
- *"I'm trying to do my part, I'm biking to work every week."*

But what surprised me the most was to find that the majority of my colleagues was in **depression** like me, basically saying "**this is a bad strategy, we feel bad, and we can't do nothing about it**":

- *"All of this is not taking the right direction. It won't be pretty in 30 years."*
- *"I've got the same concern about Airbus strategy, but those topics are very political in Airbus, sometimes the decision making doesn't seem rational."*
- *"As an environmental activist, I feel very lonely in Airbus. I come to work only to feed my children."*
- *"Actually, I think all of this is not going to end well. There will be wars, there will be deaths and maybe we won't even make it."*
- *"I personally don't fly anymore. I also think that this "rate 70 strategy" is crazy."*

Even more depressing, some people implied that **"the current strategy is dirty, but the hydrogen strategy is deceptive also"**:

- *"Hydrogen won't solve anything."*
- *"Airbus will be forced to downscale and needs to find a replacement for its cash cow, but I won't be the hydrogen aircraft, for sure."*
- *"It would be sad to discover in the end that the hydrogen aircraft communication was only a PR stunt to grab subsidies during the COVID crisis."*

## And finally acceptance

Finally, to my surprise, I found a few people being in **acceptance** with the existential threat on their company and starting to **engage in other projects**, such as *"I'm pursuing an industrial side-project to recreate jobs in after the collapse of the aerospace industry."*

One of them was also accepting the end of the world as it is and trying just to **live through it**: *"I've got used to the thought of the future collapse of our world. I'm trying to enjoy my time now, working on interesting stuff, like this hydrogen aircraft program, while I know it probably won't solve anything."*.

## A silent majority in disagreement

So after this experiment, I felt less lonely in this emotional landscape. Feeling depressed about the way the company is headed is actually more common than I thought. After classifying each of my colleagues reactions, here how I would draw now the emotional landscape in Airbus with my 13 colleagues and I ðŸ‘‡

![](https://github.com/qchenevier/public_images/raw/master/2022/5%20stages%20of%20grief%20step%202.png)

I was pretty thankful that people didn't reject me for questioning the corporate strategy. And it has been quite surprising to discover that, **behind the curtains, Airbus employees are much less corporate than we might think**.

If you are an Airbus employee feeling depressed about how Airbus handles climate change, I hope you felt less lonely after reading this article. ðŸ˜Š

It's possible that **most employees in Airbus are in disagreement** with the strategy. This sociological experiment made me revise my scenarii for Airbus' future. It may be possible that, with the worsening of climate change, **the feedback against Airbus hazardous strategy may come from inside the company**? Now, it seems to be a possible scenarii for the future.

The future will tell.
